# paper mentions at page 13:
# To obtain time-resolved predictions of the 
# turbine rotation rate, torque, and power, 
# Equation 2.7 was numerically integrated over ten surge periods
# using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme. 
# Timesteps were kept no larger than 0.001ùëá 
# to maintain numerical stability and accuracy. 
# The steady-flow turbine rotation rate ùúî0 was used 
# as the initial condition, 
# and convergence was typically established 
# within a few forcing periods. 
# The model predictions for the amplitude, 
# phase, and time-average of each quantity 
# were computed from the final period in the 
# simulation.
